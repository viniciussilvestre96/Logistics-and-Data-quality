# Supply Chain Logistics Analysis Project

## 📋 Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive logistics and supply chain dataset from Southern California (Jan 2021 - Jan 2024). The analysis focuses on operational efficiency, risk assessment, and predictive modeling for logistics disruptions.

##  Objectives
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Implement robust data cleaning pipelines using SQL and Python
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Identify patterns in logistics operations, delays, and risk factors
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build machine learning models to predict disruptions and delivery delays
- **Portfolio Development**: Demonstrate end-to-end data science skills in a real-world logistics context

##  Dataset
- **Source**: [Logistics and Supply Chain Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasetengineer/logistics-and-supply-chain-dataset)
- **Period**: January 2021 - January 2024
- **Records**: Hourly logistics operations data
- **Features**: 25+ features including GPS coordinates, fuel consumption, traffic levels, weather conditions, and risk scores

##  Technologies Used

### Data Processing
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL for data cleaning and transformation
- **Python**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For exploratory analysis and documentation

### Machine Learning
